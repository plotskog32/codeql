CodeQL
======

CodeQL is the code analysis platform used by security researchers to automate
variant analysis---the process of using a known software security vulnerability
as the seed for finding related bugs. 

Visit the links below to learn more about CodeQL, analyzing your project from the
command line using the CodeQL command-line interface, and running CodeQL
analysis in Visual Studio Code.

   Note
   
   If you've previously used the QL command-line tools, you'll notice a few
   differences. For more information, see ":doc:`Notes for legacy QL CLI users
   <notes-ql-users>`."

- :doc:`About CodeQL <about-codeql>`:
  CodeQL is the analysis engine used by developers to automate security checks, and by
  security researchers to perform variant analysis. 

- :doc:`CodeQL for Visual Studio Code extension <codeql-for-visual-studio-code>`:
  You can analyze CodeQL databases in Visual Studio Code using the CodeQL
  extension, which provides an enhanced environment for writing and running custom
  queries and viewing the results.

- :doc:`CodeQL command-line interface <codeql-cli>`: The CodeQL command-line
  interface (CLI) is used to create databases for security research. You can query
  CodeQL databases directly from the command line or using the Visual Studio Code
  extension.
