Learning CodeQL
###############

CodeQL is the code analysis platform used by security researchers to automate `variant analysis <https://semmle.com/variant-analysis>`__. 
You can use CodeQL queries to explore code and quickly find variants of security vulnerabilities and bugs. 
These queries are easy to write and shareâ€“visit the topics below and `our open source repository on GitHub <https://github.com/Semmle/ql>`__ to learn more. 
You can also try out CodeQL in the `query console <https://lgtm.com/query>`__ on `LGTM.com <https://lgtm.com>`__. 
Here, you can query open source projects directly, without having to download CodeQL databases and libraries. 

CodeQL is based on a powerful query language called QL. The following topics help you understand QL in general, as well as how to use it when analyzing code with CodeQL.
