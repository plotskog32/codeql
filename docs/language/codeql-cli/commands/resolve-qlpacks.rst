Synopsis
--------

::

  codeql resolve qlpacks <options>...

Description
-----------

Create a list of installed QL packs and their locations.

This plumbing command creates a list of QL packs that can be resolved
given the configured (or given) search path.

When run with JSON output selected, it can report multiple locations for
each pack name. When that happens, it means that the pack has conflicting
locations within a single search element, so it cannot actually be
resolved. The caller may use the actual locations to format an error
message.


Options
-------

.. program:: codeql resolve qlpacks

.. option:: --search-path=<dir>[:<dir>...]

   A list of directories under which QL packs may be found. Each
   directory can either be a QL pack (or bundle of packs containing a
   ``.codeqlmanifest.json`` file at the root) or the immediate parent of
   one or more such directories.

   If the path contains more than directory, their order defines
   precedence between them: when a pack name that must be resolved is
   matched in more than one of the directory trees, the one given first
   wins.

   Pointing this at a checkout of the open-source CodeQL repository ought
   to work when querying one of the languages that live there.

   If you have have checked out the CodeQL reposity as a sibling of the
   unpacked CodeQL toolchain, you don't need to give this option; such
   sibling directories will always be searched for QL packs that cannot
   be found otherwise. (If this default does not work, it is strongly
   recommended to set up ``--search-path`` once and for all in a per-user
   configuration file).

   (Note: On Windows the path separator is ``;``).

.. option:: --additional-packs=<dir>[:<dir>...]

   If this list of directories is given, they will be searched for packs
   before the ones in ``--search-path``. The order between these doesn't
   matter; it is an error if a pack name is found in two different places
   through this list.

   This is useful if you're temporarily developing a new version of a
   pack that also appears in the default path. On the other hand it is
   *not recommended* to override this option in a config file; some
   internal actions will add this option on the fly, overriding any
   configured value.

   (Note: On Windows the path separator is ``;``).

.. option:: --format=<fmt>

   Select output format. Choices include ``text`` (default) and ``json``.

Common options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. option:: -h, --help

   Show this help text.

.. option:: -J=<opt>

   [Advanced] Give option to the JVM running the command.

   (Beware that options containing spaces will not be handled correctly.)

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Incrementally increase the number of progress messages printed.

.. option:: -q, --quiet

   Incrementally decrease the number of progress messages printed.

.. option:: --verbosity=<level>

   [Advanced] Explicitly set the verbosity level to one of errors,
   warnings, progress, progress+, progress++, progress+++. Overrides
   ``-v`` and ``-q``.

.. option:: --logdir=<dir>

   [Advanced] Write detailed logs to one or more files in the given
   directory, with generated names that include timestamps and the name
   of the running subcommand.

   (To write a log file with a name you have full control over, instead
   give ``--log-to-stderr`` and redirect stderr as desired.)
