<overview>
<p>A switch selector is useless if it always evaluates to the same constant at runtime. This 
impedes readability and maintainability unnecessarily, by making the control-flow of the method 
more difficult to read than it should be.</p>

</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>Remove the useless switch selector and all cases that will never be reached.</p>
