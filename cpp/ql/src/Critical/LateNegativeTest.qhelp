<overview>
<p>
This query finds integer values that are first used to index an array and
subsequently tested for being negative. If it is relevant to perform this test
at all then it should happen <em>before</em> the indexing, not
after. Otherwise, if the value is negative then the program will have failed
before performing the test.
</p>

</overview>

<recommendation>
<p>
See if the value needs to be checked before being used as array index. Double-check
if the value is derived from user input. If the value clearly cannot be
negative then the negativity test is redundant and can be removed.
</p>
</recommendation>

<example>
<p>The example below includes two functions that use the value <code>recordIdx</code> to 
index an array and a test to verify that the value is positive. The test is made after 
<code>printRecord</code> is indexed and before <code>processRecord</code> is indexed. 
Unless the value of <code>recordIdx</code> cannot be negative, the test should be 
updated to run <em>before</em> both arrays are indexed.
