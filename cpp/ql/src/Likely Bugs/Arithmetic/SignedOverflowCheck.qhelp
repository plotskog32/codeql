<overview>
<p>
Testing for <code>signed</code> integer overflow by adding a
value to a variable and then comparing the result to that variable
is not defined by the C or C++ standards.  The comparison may
produce an unintended result, or may be deleted by the compiler
entirely.
</p>
</overview>
<recommendation>
<p>
Make sure that the comparison in question uses <i>unsigned</i> values.
</p>
</recommendation>
<example>
<p>
In the following example, even though <code>delta</code> has been declared
<code>unsigned short</code>, C/C++ type promotion rules require that its
type is promoted to the larger type used in the addition and comparison,
namely a <code>signed int</code>.  As a result, the entire expression is
evaluated using <code>signed</code> values and its value is therefore undefined.
</p>

<p>
In the following example, even though both <code>n</code> and <code>delta</code> 
have been declared <code>unsigned short</code>, C/C++ type promotion rules 
require that both parameters be promoted to the next bigger <code>signed</code>
integer type (in this case <code>signed int</code>) before being added together
 so as to avoid overflows or underflows.  As a result, the entire expression is
evaluated using <code>signed</code> values and its value is therefore undefined.
</p>
<sample src="SignedOverflowCheck-bad2.cpp" />
<p>
In the next example, a value of type <code>signed int</code> is
added to a value of type <code>unsigned int</code>.  Because
the types are of the same size, C/C++ promotion rules dictate that
<code>unsigned int</code> is chosen as the overall type of the addition
operation. The entire expression is evaluated using <code>unsigned</code>
values, which is allowed and defined behavior per the C/C++ standard.
