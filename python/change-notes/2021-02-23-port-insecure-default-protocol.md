* Changed the query that detects insecure SSL/TLS protocol creation from default values (`py/insecure-default-protocol`) to use the new API graphs. Python 3.2 introduced so-called contexts to create connections from. These come with new ways to specify protocol version (through modifying the `options` field), which means that using the default value _can_ be secure (and if the usage is not secure, this should be reported by the `py/insecure-protocol` query). This query now reports results only for the deprecated way of creating connections without a context.
