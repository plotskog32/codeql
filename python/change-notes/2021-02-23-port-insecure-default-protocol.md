* Updated the query that detects insecure SSL/TLS protocol creation from default values (`py/insecure-default-protocol`) to use the new API graphs. Also changed this query to not alert on using default value for constructing `ssl.SSLContext`, since that _can_ still be secure, either through manipulation of the `options` field or the `minimum_version` field. If the usage is not secure, this should be reported by the `py/insecure-protocol` query.
