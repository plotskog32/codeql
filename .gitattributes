# The following file types will be normalized to LF line endings in the Git
# database, and will keep those LF line endings in the working tree even on
# Windows. Any other files will have whatever line endings they had when they
# were committed. If you add new entries below, you should renormalize the
# affected files by running the following from the root of this repo (requires
# Git 2.16 or greater):
#
# git add --renormalize .
# git status  [just to show what files were renormalized]
# git commit -m "Normalize line endings"
#
# Also, please update .editorconfig to handle any new entries as well.
