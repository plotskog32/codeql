<p>
If a <code>HostnameVerifier</code> always returns <code>true</code> it will not verify the hostname at all.
This allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-middle attack against the application therefore breaking any security Transport Layer Security (TLS) gives.

An attack would look like this:
1. The program connects to <code>https://example.com</code>.
2. The attacker intercepts this connection and presents one of their valid certificates they control, for example one from Let's Encrypt.
3. Java verifies that the certificate has been issued by a trusted certificate authority.
4. Java verifies that the certificate has been issued for the host <code>example.com</code>, which will fail because the certificate has been issued for <code>malicious.domain</code>.
5. Java wants to reject the certificate because the hostname does not match. Before doing this it checks whether there exists a <code>HostnameVerifier</code>.
6. Your <code>HostnameVerifier</code> is called which returns <code>true</code> for any certificate so also for this one.
7. Java proceeds with the connection since your <code>HostnameVerifier</code> accepted it.
8. The attacker can now read the data (Man-in-the-middle) your program sends to <code>https://example.com</code> while the program thinks the connection is secure.

<recommendation>
<p>
Do NOT use an unverifying <code>HostnameVerifier</code>!
<li>If you use an unverifying verifier to solve a configuration problem with TLS/HTTPS you should solve the configuration problem instead.
</li>

<example>
<p>
In the first (bad) example, the <code>HostnameVerifier</code> always returns <code>true</code>.
This allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, because any certificate is accepted despite an incorrect hostname.
In the second (good) example, the <code>HostnameVerifier</code> only returns <code>true</code> when the certificate has been correctly checked.
