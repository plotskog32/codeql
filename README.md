# Semmle QL

This open source repository contains the standard QL libraries and queries that power [LGTM](https://lgtm.com), and the other products that [Semmle](https://semmle.com) makes available to its customers worldwide.

## How do I learn QL and run queries?

LGTM has [extensive documentation](https://lgtm.com/help/ql/introduction-to-ql) on getting started writing QL, and also has an [interactive query console](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/using-query-console)  that allows you to try out your queries on any open-source project that's currently being analysed.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to our standard library and standard checks, got an idea for a new check, or how to improve an existing query? Then please go ahead an open a Pull Request! Before you do though, please take the time to read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
